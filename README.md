See this discussion on the imagej forum for why this could be useful:

To get it work on FIJI, copy the file Stack_Normalizer.groovy into ImageJ.app/plugins/Scripts as detailed here :
https://imagej.net/Scripting

Then the command can be found in the main gui under Plugins > Scripts > Stack Normalizer (and it is recordable).
